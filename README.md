## Getting Started

Welcome to the OCP Java SE 17 project. Here is a guideline to help you get started:.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `sources`: the folder to maintain sources
- `classes`: the folder to store compiled classes
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Configure the Project compiler output to the `/classes` path
